## About

HackerRank is a popular platform for practicing coding skills, and this repository is dedicated to solving SQL questions available on HackerRank. Each solution is provided in a separate file, along with the corresponding question's name and description.

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them as a reference or for learning purposes. However, it's always recommended to try solving the questions on your own before referring to the solutions.

## Folder Structure
The questions are categorized by their difficulty level: `easy`, `medium`, and `hard`. Each category contains a folder with the corresponding solutions. Inside each folder, you'll find the SQL files with the solutions named according to the question they solve.
